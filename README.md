# CoachApp
Coach, is a “virtual life coach” mobile application built in Xamarin.Forms. 
The application will allow the user to create a to-do list/reminders list and it will send reminder notifications at random times throughout the day, to keep the user accountable.
The app will also have the ability for the user to create and save their own exercise routines and log their workouts in order to properly track their progress. 
The purpose of Coach is to help keep its users accountable to take action every day to work towards their goals and improve their lives.
